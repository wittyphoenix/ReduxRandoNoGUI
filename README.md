This is a headless randomizer for Super Metroid Redux I built for being run locally on a rasberry pi. There is no OS specific code, so it should compile fine into any OS.

How to use:

1. Place the application and associated files on the machine you want to execute the program
2. Apply the patches in the patches folder on top of metroid Redux/Dedux
3. Update the settings json file with the correct input and output paths for your ROM
4. Execute the program in the command line. the only required arguement is the path to the settings.json file
