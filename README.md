This is a headless randomizer for Super Metroid Redux I built for being run locally on a rasberry pi. There is no OS specific code, so it should compile fine into OS.

How to use:

1. Place the application and associated files on the machine you want to execute the program
2. Apply the "Rando Compatibility" patch to redux plus any optional patches you want to use
3. Update the settings json file with the correct input and output paths for your ROM
4. Execute the program in the command line. the only required arguement is the path to the settings.json file
